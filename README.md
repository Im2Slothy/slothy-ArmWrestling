### 3. EDITS IMPORTANT

Start your server and head to the nearest prop - prop_arm_wrestle_01 - There are more options if you want to add but you'll need to make edits. I'll prob add more in the future and make a config file. 

Now, you may want to edit the AI difficulty, Line 511 - 525. Print statements explain what happens but really thats the only thing you'll need to edit in the file tmk. ENJOY!
